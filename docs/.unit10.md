## What is Open Source?

Open source software projects have their source code completely available for anyone to use and improve. Most open source projects have their code on GitHub. This makes it extremely easy for people to contribute to them. 

```
📈 **Fun fact:** 
ICSSC projects are all open sourced. Over 50 students have contributed to the projects!
```

## Making an Open Source Contribution

1. **Fork a project**

2. **Clone your forked project**

3. **Make and commit changes**
```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "Message"
```

4. **Push your changes to your forked project**
```bash
git push
```

5. **Open a pull request**

6. **Complete the Review Process**
Now you wait for your changes to be approved by a project maintainer. 

They might request additional changes before they approve your code and merge it into the project. Making changes to an existing pull request is super easy. From your computer, you simply commit the new changes and push. The pull request should be automatically updated.

## Assignment

Your final task for the Fellowship will be to make a contribution to one of the [ICSSC Projects](https://github.com/icssc)!
We’ve set aside some simple issues with the `Fellowship` tag for y’all to work on.

- [AntAlmanac Issues](https://github.com/icssc/AntAlmanac/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afellowship)
- [PeterPortal API Issues](https://github.com/icssc/peterportal-public-api/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afellowship)
- [PeterPortal Client Issues](https://github.com/icssc/peterportal-client/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afellowship)
- [Zotistics Issues](https://github.com/icssc/Zotistics/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afellowship)
- ✨ NEW ✨ [Fellowship Website Issues](https://github.com/icssc/fellowship/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afellowship)

Once you’ve found an issue that you like, leave a comment on it to claim the task. You are only allowed to do one issue with the `Fellowship` tag because we want to make sure there are enough tasks for everyone.

However you are not limited to just these issues. If you’d rather try a harder issue or if have your own idea for how to improve a project, feel free to do so! You can work on as many other issues as you like.

If you have any questions about the projects, ask in the project Discord channels!
