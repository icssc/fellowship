## VS Code
Before we get started developing websites, we need somewhere to write our code!
**Visual Studio Code** is a very popular text editor used for all types of development. With many different extensions and lots of customizable settings, it's very flexible. 

### VS Code Download
You can download VS Code from the offical website: https://code.visualstudio.com/

### Code Terminal Command
One small cool feature is that in your terminal, you can add the `code` command, so that if you type `code <some directory or file>`, it will open up the file/directory in VS Code! 

- For Windows and Linux, this should be automatically installed.
- For Mac, to get `code` added to your terminal, just follow these [three steps](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line).

## HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML is not a programming language; it is a **markup** language. It tells web browsers how to structure the web pages that you visit.  HTML consists of a series of elements, which can contain such as a text, image, or any other content. Each element is enclosed by tags that can specify unique attributes of the content.

![HTML Tags](../static/img/unit4/html-tags.png)

Here are some common tags that you might use:

```html
<h1> Heading level 1 </h1>
<h2> Heading level 2 </h2>
<p> A paragraph of text </p>
<!-- a comment that does not get written into your web page -->
<img /> <!-- an image -->
<ul> <!-- an unordered list with bullet points -->
	<li> list item 1 </li>
	<li> list item 2 </li>
</ul>  
<strong> **Important content that is bolded** </strong>
<em> *Emphasized content that is italicized* </em>
<div> A division or section of content </div>
```

Note that some elements like `<img>` have a self-closing tag. How does it know what the content is? More on that later...

### Nesting

Elements can be placed as the content of other elements.
```html
<div>
	<p>I <strong>love</strong> HTML!</p>
</div>
```

The following is an example of the ***wrong*** way to do nesting:

```html
<p>The WRONG way to do <strong>nesting.</p></strong> <!-- Don't do this -->
```

The **tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or outside one another**. With the kind of overlap in the example above, the browser would be unsure what your intentions are.

### Attributes

Elements can also have **attributes**. The attributes of an element contain extra information that doesn't appear in the content. 

![HTML Attributes](../static/img/unit4/html-attributes.png)

Attributes specify options and add meaning. They are space-separated lists of names and values. (Kind of like variables.)

```html
<div attributeA="valueA" attributeB="valueB">
	Content goes here
</div>
<a href="https://facebook.com">Facebook</a>
```

Getting back to the `<img>` tag, it uses attributes to know what content to display. 

```html
<img src="/path/to/image.png">
```

Every tag can have a `class` and `id` attribute. They are just like any attribute, but they are often used to identify specific tags in CSS and JavaScript.

```html
<div class="widget foo" id="baz"></div>
```

Some things to consider about the `class` and `id` attribute: 

- They are just like any other attribute (href, src).
- An element can have many classes, only one ID.
- Each page can have only one element with a given ID.
- Can use the same class on multiple elements.
    - It's useful to apply the same style to many elements.

🧠 Pro Tip: IDs can be used for navigation (i.e.: <a href="https://marsc.dev/#experience" target="_blank">https://marsc.dev/#experience</a> will take you directly to the experience section.)

### A full HTML document

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
	<!--- The `head` is for meta data, and importing styles/scripts --->
    <title>My test page</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>

  <body>
	<!--- The `body` is where the content of your website goes --->
    <p>This is my page</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### HTML Reference

There are hundreds of tags, each with different default behaviors, that you can check out on [W3 Schools' HTML Element Reference page](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/).

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document that is written in HTML. Unlike HTML which provides the structure for the document, CSS provides the styling and how the document is presented. 

### CSS syntax

- Selectors specify which elements a rule applies to.
- Rules specify what values to assign to different formatting properties.

```css
selector {
	property: value;
	property: value;
	...
}
```

In this case, we select all HTML elements with the `p` tag. These elements will use the font 'Arial', and be colored red.

```css
p {
	font-family: 'Arial';
	color: red;
}
```

There are three main ways of selecting HTML to style: Element, ID, and Class. Remember, ID and class can be set as attributes for each element. There are also more, base don attribute, or pseudo-classes. 

```css
p { /* Select by element tag */
	font-family: 'Arial';
	color: red;
}
.emphasize { /* Select by element class */
	font-family: 'Arial';
	color: red;
}

#redtext { /* Select by element id */
	font-family: 'Arial';
	color: red;
}

img[src] { /* Select img with src attribute */
	width: 500px;
}

a:hover { /* When 'a' tags are hovered by your mouse they become blue */
	color: blue
}
```

### CSS Reference

Mozilla has a full list of supported properties on their [CSS Reference Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference#index).

### Specifying Styles

The best practice way of specifying styles is to create a separate `<name>.css` file, where you will put all your styles and rules. 

```html
<head>
	 <!-- Use the './css/style.css' file for styling this document -->
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/style.css">
</head>
<body>
	...
</body>
```

### The Box Model 🔲

CSS is all about boxes, in how the entire page is laid out. Each box has multiple properties in how they take up space: 

- `padding` - the space around the content. In the example below, it is the space around the paragraph text.
- `border` - the solid line that is just outside the padding.
- `margin` - the space around the outside of the border. This is used to separate elements from its neighbors
- `width` - the width of the content
- `height` - the height of the content

Padding, border and margin have direction properties. (e.g., padding-top,
margin-right, border-left). 

Borders can have a `border-color`, `border-width`, and `border-style`.

![Box Model](../static/img/unit4/box-model.png)

### Units

For the above properties, they all can be set with certain units. 

| Unit | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Pixels (px) | 1 pixel |
| Element units (em) | Relative to the font-size of the element.  |
| Percentages (%) | Relative to the parent element. |
| Real-world units (in, cm) | An inch, or centimeter. Not recommended to use. |
| Viewport (vh, vw) | Relative to 1% of the width/height of the viewport, or display. (100vh = 100% of the height of the viewport. |
- Try to use relative units (em and %) whenever possible. Helps for accessibility, when users change default sizes.
- Don't use real-world units, as these are fixed regardless of device.

### Display

The [display property](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/d/display/) is one of the most important CSS properties for controlling layout. Let's take a look at a few of the more common ones.

- `inline` - Does not start on a newline and only takes up as much width as necessary.
    - Examples of inline-level elements: `<span>`, `<a>`, `<img>`
- `block` - Always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.
    - Examples of block-level elements: `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>` - `<h6>`
- `none` - Hides the content.
- `flex` - An efficient way to lay out, align, and distribute space among items in a container.
	- Understanding flex is critical if 

### Flexbox
The `flex` display property is so important, that we are giving it its own section.  
Take 1 minute to glace over the [Flexbox Properties Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-flexbox-properties) on this CSS Tricks page.

Imagine we have a div with 3 items in it. 
```html
<div class="container">
	<div>Item 1</div>
	<div>Item 2</div>
	<div>Item 3</div>
</div>
```
How would we arrange these items into a row that is centered in the middle of the div?
We can use flexbox!
```css
.container {
	/* Give the container a display of flex */
	display: flex;

	/* Set the direction to be row */
	flex-direction: row;

	/* Center the content in the middle */
	justify-content: center;	/* horizontally centered */
	align-items: center;		/* vertically centered */
}
```

Flexbox has a lot of powerful options. Here are a few from the [Flexbox Properties Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-flexbox-properties) linked above.

| Rows and Columns | Horizontal Alignment | Vertical Alignment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| flex-direction | justify-content | align-items | 
| [<img src="/img/unit4/flex/rows-cols.png" alt="Flex Direction Example" style={{height: "200px"}}/>](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-flex-direction) | [<img src="/img/unit4/flex/justify-content.png" alt="Justify Content Types" style={{height: "400px"}}/>](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-justify-content)| [<img src="/img/unit4/flex/align-items.png" alt="Align Items Types" style={{height: "400px"}} />](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-align-items) |

Fireship has another great video explaining Flexbox and how to size and align the child elements.

## GitHub Pages

Alright so now that you have the beginning of an awesome website, how do you share it with the world? 
We need somewhere to host the website. 
**GitHub Pages allows us to deploy our site quickly, easily, and for free**.

To activate GitHub pages for your repository:
1. Click on the “Settings” tab
2. Click “Pages”
3. Select “main” as your Source Branch
4. Click “Save”
5. Check “Enforce HTTPS”

![GitHub Pages](../static/img/unit4/gh-pages.png)

Now, whenever you push a new commit to the `main` branch of your repository, the website will be **automatically updated**.
